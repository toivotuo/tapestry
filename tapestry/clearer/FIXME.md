Nice to have features
---------------------

  - In pacs.008 <BtchBookg> is supported: "Identifies whether a single
    entry per individual transaction or a batch entry for the sum of
    the amounts of all transactions within the group of a message is
    requested." The Clearer could use this to decide whether to book
    in batch with Settler or not. This is only relevant for DNS, not
    RTGS.
