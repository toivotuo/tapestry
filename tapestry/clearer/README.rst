Clearer
=======

.. FIXME, this text is copied from LyX and is not edited

The Clearer component supports the Router component in managing the
obligations of different PSPs and PSUs in the role of Tapestry as a
CSM. The Clearer component provides real-time clearing against
settlements accounts maintained for PSPs and PSUs in the Ledger
component. Settlements are effected through the Settler component by
the Router. The Clearer component does not do netting (see Figure
[subsec:clearing-payment-transactions]) and the clearing and settling
paradigm is closer to an RTGS than a DTNS (see Section
[subsec:net-gross-settlement]).
