File Exchanger
==============

The File Exchanger or 'fex' app provides facilities for a Tapestry
instance to send and receive payment messages from PSUs or PSPs as
well as from peer or upstream CSMs.

.. Each payment message is represented by a 'Message' model.

.. FIXME: Not ready this documentation is.
