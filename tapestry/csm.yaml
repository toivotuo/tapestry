# We use the 'bic' as the identifier for the interface to which the
# PSP is connected to on the router.

# FIXME: We should describe separately the interfaces for routing,
# both ingress and egress, and what protocols are being used like
# HTTPS, MQ or EBICS.

# FIXME: We're missing a description of how we would have routing tables fed in.
