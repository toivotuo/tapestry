Settler
=======

.. FIXME, this text is copied from LyX and is not edited

The Settler component supports the Router component in effecting the
settlements for payments cleared in the Clearer component. Each
payment transaction is settles individually against settlement
accounts maintained in the Ledger component for PSPs and PSUs
connected to a Tapestry instance. As each payment transaction is
individually cleared and settled in real-time the paradigm for
settlements is RTGS (see Section [subsec:net-gross-settlement]).
