The Ledger component maintains the settlement accounts for PSPs and
PSUs connected to a Tapestry instance. The Settler component instructs
the accounting entries stored in the Ledger component. Account
reservations instructed by the Clearer component are also maintained
in the Ledger component. A standard double-entry accounting system is
implemented in the Ledger component.
